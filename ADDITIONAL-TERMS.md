# Additional terms with the AGPLv3 License

## NonFurry

Without express permission granted by CthulhuOnIce (CthulhuOnIce000@gmail.com), any derivitive works may not be used 
for the purposes of serving the "Furry Fandom", or any other group that centers around the anthropomorphising of real or fictional non-human animals.

## NonErotic

Without express permission granted by CthulhuOnIce (CthulhuOnIce000@gmail.com), any derivitive works of this code must not be created
for, or have any code modifications for, the purpose of sexual entertainment, sexual pleasure, or sexual stimulation.

## NonImpersonation

Without express permission granted by CthulhuOnIce (CthulhuOnIce000@gmail.com), any derivitive works, when hosted on the BYOND gaming platform,  must not carry a
title (SERVERNME) that has the word "Genesis", or any word that is pronounced phonetically as "Genesis". Using the description config 
feature provided within this codebase, you may add a description, (SERVERDESC) with the word "Genesis", for example, "Genesis-code", or "Genesis-derived server".

Additionally, when using the Genesis name in one's serverdesc, there must not be any attempt made to convince users ("players") that the server is the "Official" version,
or any version operated by CthulhuOnIce.

Forks of this codebase may have the title "Genesis", on their repository, if and only if used for these purposes:

    - Private / Personal use (not hosted to the public, rather to a closed group)
    - Development (one's own non-released codebase, or a fork made to submit code changes to upstream)
    - Archive (Forking the code without changing it, for the purpose of keeping a record)

To clarify, you may not use the name "Genesis" on the BYOND Hub, but you may use the name "Genesis" on your source code
repository **if and only if** it meets one or more of the above requirements.
